    <H5>Building/Structures:
        There are three main structures situated in about an acre of land, The main building is the church with a seating capacity of 800 people when completed. The other structure is the office block with 5 rooms for church offices and 1 room for kitchen. The third block houses the washrooms with male and female facilities. It houses both the church and the presbytery seat.
        The church structure has been under construction from 2007 constructed from funds contributed by church members.it is still under construction especially the section of offices and the childrenâ€™s church, we entered the site in 2001 using a temporary structure for the church which was taken down in 2009. The work has progressed slowly because our membership has been low, however we welcome contributions from those whom God have moved to help us.
